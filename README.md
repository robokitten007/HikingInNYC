# HikingInNYC
## Background
Public recreational space is important for the well-being of city dewellers and should always receive sufficient considertions in the city planning and development process. In this project, I attempt to use publicly available data from NYC OpenData to explore, compare and visulize the current status of hiking trails around the five boroughs of the city of New York. Which borogh is the most city-hiking friendly and which is not? Let's dig in together and find out!

## Functionality & MVs
In this project, users will be able to view relevant data in the form of bar charts with the following attributes:
- the level of difficulty, the total number, and the length of the trails in each of the five boroughs;
- the level of difficulty, the total number, and the length of the trails in each park location;
- the total no. of trails and length of trails accessible/not accessible by wheelchair;
- when viewing info on trails' level of difficulty and length, users will be able to select which child info to review (i.e. the sum/avaerge/max/min of the length, and max/min/median for the level of difficulty)  

In addition, the project will also include 
- a production README

## Wireframes

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
The project will be built with HTML, SCSS and Javascirpt. Dynamic rendering of the page will be serviced using plain Javascript and DOM manipulation. No jquery should be used.
This porject also plans to use the following:
- Data source: publicly availuble data from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
- The `D3.js` library to render interactive data visualization
## Implementation Timeline
- Weekend: Set up project skeleton,  Create Github repo, and submit project proposal
- Monday: Get comfortable with D3 library, 
- Tuesday:
- Wednesday: 
- Thursday: half a day to clean up the code and rewrite production README if applicable.  Deploy the code to GitHub page.
